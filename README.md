# Restarting Your Process Via `live_update`

Tilt's Live Update functionality allows you to copy files to, and run commands on, running containers. Some apps or invocations thereof (e.g. Javascript apps run via `nodemon`, or Flask apps run in debug mode) detect and incorporate code changes without needing to restart. For other apps, though, youâ€™ll need to restart them for changes to take effect.

This set of scripts is one way to restart your process as part of a Live Update.

For more information on restarting processes during Live Update, [see the docs](https://docs.tilt.dev/live_update_reference.html#restarting-your-process)

## How to Use These Scripts

For an example, see the [the onewatch integration test](https://github.com/windmilleng/tilt/tree/master/integration/onewatch).

Copy `start.sh` and `restart.sh` to your container working dir.

If your container entrypoint *was* `path/to/binary [arg1] [arg2]...`, change it to:
```
./start.sh path/to/binary [arg1] [arg2]...
```

(The `entrypoint` parameter on `docker_build`/`custom_build` is a lightweight way to do this.)

To restart the container as part of your Live Update, use a `run` step that calls the restart script: `run('./restart.sh')`

So, for example:

```python
docker_build('gcr.io/windmill-test-containers/integration/onewatch',
    '.',
    entrypoint=['./start.sh', '/go/bin/onewatch'],
    live_update=[
        sync('.', '/go/src/github.com/windmilleng/tilt/integration/onewatch'),
        run('go install github.com/windmilleng/tilt/integration/onewatch'),
        run('./restart.sh'),
    ])
```

This live update will cause the `go install` to be run in the container every time anything in the `.` path locally changes. After the `go install` is run, `./restart.sh` will be run. This will kill the original entrypoint, and restart it, effectively simulating the `container_restart()` functionality on Docker.

## Non-Supported Cases

### Containers Without Shell
At the risk of stating the obvious: your container needs to have shell available to run these shell scripts.

These scripts look for a shell at `/bin/sh`; if your shell lives elsewhere, you have to explicitly invoke the scripts with that shell, e.g.:
```python
docker_build(...,
    entrypoint=['/busybox/sh', './start.sh', 'path/to/binary'],
    ...
)
```

### Subprocesses (Not Necessarily Supported)
These scripts will only work as well as signal handling between your parent process and its subprocesses; use with care.

Specifically, `restart.sh` only knows how to kill the top-level process invoked by `start.sh`; it's up to that process to clean up its subprocesses on receiving `SIGTERM`, or else you'll be left with orphans.
